# SAO Vaccine Pass

A very inspired UI for showing your vaccine pass in Hong Kong. 

Coded without any use of frameworks, which should make it load very quickly. 

## Background

https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/198149/Hong-Kong-drops-LeaveHomeSafe-check-in-mandate,-amber-code-scrapped

For some people, it may not be desirable to use LeaveHomeSafe anymore when the need is just to present a Vaccine QR code. 

This is especially true due to the permissions it requests and the data it transmits. 

## Usage guide

Use either ```index.html``` or ```offline.html```. SVG files need to be placed in the same directory for ```index.html```. 

Edit ```scancontent``` variable in the HTML file or else it will link to https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ

## Custom skins

Edit the ```top```, ```bottom``` images respectively. 

## Todos

Easier means of changing QR code content. 

Easier means of changing "Vaccine QR code" text to something else without using Adobe Illustrator.
